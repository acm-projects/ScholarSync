Due to the extensive use of agrochemicals in agriculture, the necessity to meet the expanding demand for food has also resulted in unsustainable farming practices. Around the world, biochar, a multipurpose carbonaceous material, is being used to concurrently solve issues with enhancing soil fertility, plant growth, and development under both normal and stressful circumstances. It improves water retention, fosters nutrient absorption, and promotes microbial activity, creating a fertile environment that supports sustainable and resilient agriculture. Additionally, biochar acts as a carbon sink, contributing to long-term carbon sequestration and mitigating climate change impacts. The major benefit of biochar is that it helps the adsorption process with its highly porous structures and different functional groups. Understanding the elements involved in biochar formation that determine its characteristics and adsorptive capacity is necessary to assure the viability of biochar in terms of plant productivity and soil health, particularly biological activity in soil. This paper focuses on the development, composition, and effects of biochar on soil fertility and health, and crop productivity.\n\n**Keywords:** biochar, crop productivity, organic amendments, microbial activity, soil fertility, sustainable agriculture\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nPromising strategies for ensuring food security for a growing world population include increasing production per unit area and sustainably improving agricultural productivity. Research is being conducted around the world on the potential benefits of using biochar as a solution of food security by enhancing crop productivity [1,2,3]. The application of biochar is coherent with modern green development concepts as it plays critical roles in maintaining ecosystem balance, controlling soil pollution, and the sustainable development of the agricultural environment [4]. Biochar is a carbon-rich and porous material produced through the thermal decomposition of biomass, such as plant residues, agricultural waste, or wood, under controlled oxygen-limited conditions. This process, known as pyrolysis, involves heating the biomass to high temperatures in the absence or near absence of oxygen, preventing complete combustion. The result is a stable form of charcoal that contains a well-structured network of pores called biochar [5]. It has attracted a lot of attention in the last decade due to its numerous benefits in various fields, including soil health, agriculture, wastewater treatment, and climate change [6]. Improving soil quality, productivity, and carbon sequestration"
