## Roadblocks and Possible Solutions

**Matching Algorithm Accuracy:**
- Challenge: Creating accurate student-project matching based on skills and interests.
- Solution: Start with rule-based matching using tags and keywords, evolve to ML-based models with user feedback.

**Web Scraping Complexity:**
- Challenge: Inconsistent faculty website formats and potential scraping restrictions.
- Solution: Use robust scraping libraries (BeautifulSoup, Selenium) with fallback to manual curation.

**Tech Stack Complexity:**
- Challenge: Managing multiple AWS services increases setup and maintenance complexity.
- Solution: Implement services incrementally, maintain comprehensive documentation, and use Infrastructure as Code.

**Paper Access and Licensing:**
- Challenge: Many academic papers are behind paywalls.
- Solution: Focus on open-access databases initially, allow user PDF uploads through institutional access.

## Competition

**Existing Solutions:**
- **UTD Faculty Profiles:** Lists research interests but lacks centralized search and matching.
- **Google Scholar/Semantic Scholar:** Paper discovery without personalization or collaboration features.
- **ResearchGate:** Professional networking but limited student-faculty project matching.

**Key Differentiators:**
- Personalized AI-powered recommendations using NLP.
- Built-in paper summarization and collaborative annotation.
- Intelligent faculty-student matchmaking based on skills and interests.
- Integrated research project tracking and communication tools.
